The horse is mid-stride, with a dynamic pose, wearing a bright blue racing silks with a white stripe. The background shows a green track with a blurred crowd in the stands. The finish line banner reads 'Race Day' in bold lettering. The overall color palette is vibrant with greens, blues, and gold accents.

#### can you make it randomize the winner every time the user plays repeatedly and make the backround more lively like using GIFs and make a simple reward when the user wins a race  
####  

The changes you’re asking for will touch the parts of the app that:

1. **Run the race logic** – the component or page that decides the winner and updates the UI.  
2. **Render the background** – the component that shows the track or scenery (so we can swap a static image for a GIF).  
3. **Show the reward** – the component that displays a prize when the user wins.  

The most likely files that need edits are:

- `mini-app/components/race.tsx` (or whatever component contains the race‑simulation logic)  
- `mini-app/components/background.tsx` (or the component that renders the track background)  
- `mini-app/components/reward.tsx` (or the component that shows the win reward)  
- `mini-app/app/page.tsx` (if the race is started from the main page)  

Please add the file(s) that contain the race logic and background rendering to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks. Once you add them, I’ll stop and wait for your confirmation.

I need the file(s) that contain the race logic and the background rendering so I can add the random winner, GIF background, and reward display. Please add those files to the chat.

The following files are the most likely candidates that will need to be edited to implement the requested features (random winner, GIF background, and a simple reward display):

- `mini-app/components/race.tsx`  
- `mini-app/components/background.tsx`  
- `mini-app/components/reward.tsx`  
- `mini-app/app/page.tsx`  

Please add these files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

I need the files that contain the race logic, the background rendering, and the reward display so I can add the random winner, GIF background, and reward component. Please add those files to the chat.

#### Just make the backround simple delete the gifs prompt and make a build so that the can keep playing and can stop anytime  

The files that will most likely need to be edited to implement the requested changes are:

```
mini-app/components/background.tsx
mini-app/components/race.tsx
mini-app/components/reward.tsx
mini-app/app/page.tsx
```

Please add these files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

I only have the `mini-app/app/page.tsx` file.  
To implement the random winner, simple background, and reward display, I’ll need the component files that contain the race logic, the background rendering, and the reward UI.  

Could you add the following files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks?

- `mini-app/components/background.tsx`  
- `mini-app/components/race.tsx`  
- `mini-app/components/reward.tsx`
